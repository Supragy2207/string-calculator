# String Calculator - TDD

Implements the String Calculator kata entirely via **Test-Driven Development**.

## Run
npm install
npm test


## Rules Implemented
- Empty string → 0  
- Single number → same number  
- Multiple comma/newline separated numbers → sum  
- Custom delimiters via `//<delim>\n`  
- Multi-length & multiple delimiters via `//[delim1][delim2]\n`  
- Throws error listing all negative numbers   

## TDD Process
Followed the three laws strictly:
1. Wrote failing test first  
2. Wrote only enough code to pass that one test  
3. Refactored after tests passed  

Each commit shows this flow — small, focused, and readable.
